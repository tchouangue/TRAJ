Description: Implements the three-step procedure proposed by Leffondree et al. (2004) to identify clusters of individual longitudinal trajectories. The procedure involves (1) calculating 24 measures describing the features of the trajectories; (2) using factor analysis to select a subset of the 24 measures and (3) using cluster analysis to identify clusters of trajectories, and classify each individual trajectory in one of the clusters.
